# Developer Notes for  Coco

This is a collection of developer notes for the Coco project. Topics include developer onboarding, project
structure, scripts and developer workflow.

## Getting Started

**Running the project**
* git clone the repository to a local directory 
* `npm install` 
* wait for code compilation 
* `npm start` (runs a local webserver)

**Developer workflow**
* When making changes to JS files run `npm run fast`
* When making changes to _custom.less_ close npm server and run `gulp` for the file watch and livereload (switch back to 
`npm start` when you're done)

## Project Information

### Scripts
All the project `npm install/fast` scripts are within the `/scripts` directory.

**npm install**
The install script sets the project to production mode in `config.js` for GitHub hosting purposes. For development,
purposes set the variable back to `false`.

### Queries
In a nutshell, queries are in the `/queries` directory and get concatenated to `ClientContants.js` with the
`scripts/concatqueries.js` when running `npm install/fast`.

New queries should be create in the `/queries` directory and use the same template as existing queries.

### Hosting the Project
The changes made to this fork are manually transferred to this 
[repository](https://github.com/ericdesj/moz-coco-w17-preview). We use GitHub Pages to host the project for free and
make it available for demo or testing. The page is available [here](https://ericdesj.github.io/moz-coco-w17-preview/).

### Relay service
To avoid issues with CORS we built a relay service for Mozilla hg where you can get raw files or markup code (to borrow
syntax highlighting from hg). You can deploy the service for your personal use to Heroku with the 'Deploy to Heroku' 
button. Check the repo out [here](https://github.com/ericdesj/moz-coco-relay).
